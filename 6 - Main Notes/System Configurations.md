Subsystems description:
- **Input transducer:** Convert the form of the input to that used by the *controller*. The input can be called of the *reference* too;
- **Controller:** Drives a *process* or a *plant*;
- **Summing Junctions:** Yield the algebraic sum of their input signals using associated signals. Ex: We can added other signals, such as *disturbances*, to the controller and process outputs using this block;

**Example of a open-loop system:** *The plant can be a furnace or air conditioning system, where the output variable is temperature. The controller in a heating system consists of fuel valves and the electrical system that operates the valves.*
