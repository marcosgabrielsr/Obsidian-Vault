### Interface:

**Galery:** By right-clicking you can access the gallery

**Side toolbar:**
	- **Move:** The first option. Allows you to move the object on the x, y and z axes
	- **Scale:** The second option. Allows the object to be scaled in different directions.
	- **Rotate:** It allows you to rotate the object around its x,y and z axes. The system allows you to rotate every 45° or 5° precisely.
	- **Place on face:** Aligns one side of the object with the print table.
	- **Cut:** It allows cut parts of the object.
	- **Paint-on Support:** It allows paint parts of the object to the systems put support in the painted parts.
	- **Seam Painting:** It allows hidden sewing lines.

### Layers and Perimeters:

If the object has problems adhering to the table, changing the height of the first layer can help solve the problem. In these cases, the height of the first layer should be 150% of the height of the other layers.

The perimeters are the walls of the object. Inner perimeters are yellow and outer perimeters are orange.

**Horizontal Shells (Solid top and bottom layers):** For layers 0.2 mm high, 4-5 Solid Top Layers and 3-4 Solid Base Layers are indicated.

**Thick bridges**: Bridges are solid top layers that have not infill or support. This option makes the bridges heigth become equal the heigth slyares.

***
### Filling:

**Filling:** Its main purpose is to provide support for the upper layers. It affects printing speed, structural strength, filament consumption and the external appearance of printed objects.

**Ironing:*** This function smooths the upper flat surfaces as the hot nozzle travels over the newly printed layer. The nozzle also extrudes a small amount of filament to plug any gaps in the top layer.
